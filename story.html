                Earlier yesterday a team of highly trained individuals; Bazett, Sutcliff, Joop, and Sanji, were sent out to obtain a book containing a formula to a serum that would allow one person to brainwash whomever is injected. After obtaining the book a huge storm erupted and the team was forced to take refuge in Slickback’s mansion. Slickback was in the middle of a poker game with Sebastian, Revy, and Uruk when the team arrived inside. An hour past midnight a murder and robbery started to occur.

                Detective: Good morning detective. Thank you for joining us today. This is one intense case we have on our hands. Here is what we know so far…
                <br>
                At 1:17am we got a distressed call at the station from Bazett stating she was in bed when she heard gunshots from the foyer. Bazett claims Sutcliff and herself  ran together to look at the commotion. There Sutcliff’s friend that had helped the team was dead with the book missing from her satchel. Upon our arrival the crime scene has the young trainee lying on her back, feet facing the stairs, with a gunshot wound to the left temple. It was one shot, perfectly placed, the shooter must be very skilled. On the top floor, near the west stairwell railings we found a shell casing. We are still interviewing our suspects. Feel free to talk to them yourself for more clues as to what may have happened here and where that book is! Let me know what you find, detective.
